                Water pollution is a threat to the lives of water dwelling
                organisms and the ecosystems they support, food chains and
                habitats.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pollution of water is as a result of several factors such as
                industrial effluent, agricultural effluent, sewage and plastics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Contaminated water leads to various diseases such as stomach
                diseases, skin diseases, and contact with toxic substances.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are measures that can be taken to minimize water pollution
                and they include; proper disposal of wastes, encouraging the use
                of environmentally friendly methods in farming and ensuring that
                laws are followed to the letter regarding water bodies.

          <h2>Sources of Water Pollution</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Pollution of water begins from different sources such as industrial,
            sewage discharge, agricultural drainage, effluent discharge, and
            plastic waste. Industrial effluent brings in undesirable substances
            and metals into water bodies, while agricultural runoff contains
            pesticides, fertilizers, and animal waste. Sewage disposal puts
            pathogens and biomass, and plastics add to the stock of litter.
            microplastics in aquatic environments.

          <h2>Impact on Ecosystems</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Water pollution has severe effects on ecosystems and the following
            are some of the effects that are observed. the mortality of water
            inhabitants, species diversity, and interference of food chains.
            Pollutants can lead to eutrophication, which is the excessive
            nutrients cause algal blooms that reduce oxygen concentrations, thus
            affecting fish and other water dwelling animals. The pollution of
            water also has an impact on the health of wetlands, rivers and lakes
            which are important habitats for many species.

          <h2>Human Health Risks</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            People are affected by water pollution through direct consumption of
            impure water, touching water that is polluted, and drinking
            contaminated seafood. This can result in different health problems,
            such as gastrointestinal diseases, skin infections and chronic
            contact with hazardous materials such as heavy metals and chemicals,
            which may lead to severe health complications such as cancer and
            neurological diseases.

          <hr />
          <p>
            The economic effects of water pollution are severe. that impact
            sectors like fishing, tourism, and agriculture. The depletion of
            fish stocks and pollution of recreational water bodies may result in
            low earnings for the communities that rely on these resources. Also,
            the cost of purifying polluted water sources and solving health
            problems associated with water pollution is a cost to governments
            and individuals as a result of the disease.
